## Quick Start with Tailwind CSS CDN

You can quickly test Tailwind CSS by including it directly in your HTML file using the CDN. Follow these steps:

1. Open your HTML file.

2. Add the following script tag in the `<head>` section:

   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
   ```

3. Use Tailwind CSS classes in your HTML elements. For example:

   ```html
   <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">
     This is a sample element styled with Tailwind CSS.
   </div>
   ```

4. Preview your HTML file in a browser to see the styling applied.

Note: This approach is suitable for quick testing and prototyping. For production use, consider setting up Tailwind CSS using the recommended installation and build process.
