 Q.Why is it called "Index"?
->The term "Index" is used in web development because it represents the primary or starting page of a website.
->It is named this way because it serves as the default page that users see when they visit a website, making 
  it the initial point of interaction.

<!--represents the version of HTML which is in this case is 5 as for HTML ver.4 it's something else-->
<html lang="en">
  <!--en - English represents the language of documentation-->
  <head>
    <!--Contains instructions / meta-information about the HTML document, such as ->character set ->viewport settings ->the document's title-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <!--metadata, is information about the data within an HTML document, it's specifying information about the character encoding-->
    <!--'charset' attribute in the <meta> tag specifies the character encoding -->
    <!--Sets the character encoding to UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters and helps to run websites for international audience-->
    <!--UTF-8, which stands for Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit, is a character encoding standard that is widely used in computing and on the internet-->
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <!--This meta tag is used to define the document compatibility mode specifically for Internet Explorer (IE)-->
    <!--Why not other Browsers? This tag is not typically needed or recognized by other modern browsers (Chrome..) as they do have modern rendering engines(displaying web pages by translating code HTML...) -->
    <!--It instructs IE to use the highest available document mode, which helps ensure that the webpage is rendered consistently-->
    <!--'http-equiv' stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol equivalent, and it allows you to set values that are equivalent to HTTP response headers-->
    <!--When your browser requests a webpage, the server sends back response headers, providing details like content type, last modification date, and more, with the Content-Type header specifying the type of content (e.g., HTML, images).-->
    <!--'X-UA-Compatible'  is an instruction for IE to use a specific rendering mode -->
    <!--content="IE=edge" - webpage should be displayed in the highest mode available, ensuring the best rendering for the version of IE being used. -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!--name="viewport": This attribute specifies that the meta tag is defining the viewport settings for the webpage -->
    <!--viewport is like a window on your device where you see a webpage -->
    <!--content="width=device-width" -> width of the viewport to the width of the device's screen -->
    <!--initial-scale=1.0 sets the initial zoom to 1.0, meaning no zoom-->
