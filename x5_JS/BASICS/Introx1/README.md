**History** 

- **1995:** JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Originally named "Mocha," it was later renamed "LiveScript" and finally "JavaScript."
- **1996:** Microsoft introduced JScript, their own version of JavaScript for Internet Explorer. This led to some compatibility issues between browsers.
- **1997:** JavaScript was standardized as ECMAScript by Ecma International to ensure cross-browser compatibility. ECMAScript 3 was the widely adopted version.
- **2009:** ECMAScript 5 brought significant improvements, including new methods and better support for working with objects.
- **2015:** ECMAScript 6 (ES6) introduced major enhancements like classes, arrow functions, and let/const variables. It marked a significant milestone in JavaScript's evolution.
- **Present:** JavaScript continues to evolve, with new features and improvements added regularly. ECMAScript 2021 (ES12) is the latest standard at the time of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.

Two main versions are ES5 and ES6 they do differentiate alot from each other like as ES5 do have ‘var‘ whereas in ES6 have ‘let’

JavaScript is now a crucial part of web development, used for both client-side and server-side scripting, thanks to technologies like Node.js. It's one of the most widely used programming languages globally.

EcmaScript : It is standard on which Javascript is based 

—>It was created to ensure that different documents on JS are actually talking about the same language 

—> JS and Ecmascript can almost be used intechangably.JS is very liberal in what it allows
